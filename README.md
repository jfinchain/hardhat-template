# Sample Hardhat Project for JFIN Chain

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
yarn
cp .env.example .env
export PRIVATE_KEY=[private key without 0x]
npx hardhat deploy  --network jfin --reset   --tags JFA 
npx hardhat sourcify  --network jfin    --endpoint https://trustcontract.dev/server

```
